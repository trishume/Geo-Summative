<h1>The Trip</h1>

<p>
I plan to drive to Niagara Falls with my family.<br/>
The trip will take approximately 7 hours 30 minutes with breaks and a stop for lunch.<br/>
The total distance of the route is 566km.<br/>
</p>

<p>
We will start driving at around 11:00 on July 25th.<br/>
The route will start from my house. Go south towards the US border and Kingston, Go SW along lake Ontario to Toronto, then follow the contour of Lake Ontario to my hotel in Niagara Falls.<br/>
Approximate time of arrival is 6:10PM on July 25th.
</p>

<p>
The route would take around 6 hours 30 minutes without stops.<br/>
However by around 1:00 we will reach Kingston and have lunch at one of the many fast-food restaurants there. This will take approximately 30m<br/>
It is also likely that we will occasionally take a small break at a Tim Hortons or other stop along the highway.<br/>
The food will cost approximately <b>$11</b> including snacks.</br>
</p>

<p>
Our van gets approximately 7.7 kilometres per litre and the trip is 566km.<br/>
This means we will use around 73.5 litres of gas each way.<br/>
At the current gas price of $1.22 per litre the trip should cost around <b>$90</b>
