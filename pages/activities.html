<h1>Activities</h1>
<p>Niagara Falls has more tourist attractions than you could visit in a month. I have chosen some activities that I think would be worth doing on my trip. I can always come back again to do other activities.</p>

<h2>Niagara Heritage Trail</h2>
<p>A path along the river bank that visits many different historical locations. Some of the locations include a historic manor, the Laura Secord homestead, Old Fort Erie, a monument to the battle of Queenston Heights, and a war of 1812 battlefield. This will be my cultural activity. If I want to see the modern culture of Niagara Falls, I can go visit a honeymoon suite.</p>
<h2>Maid of the Mist</h2>
<p>A boat ride into the basin of the Horseshoe Falls. The ride has been around since 1818 when the first Maid was built. Now the boats are multileveled diesel powered tour boats. Everybody wears blue plastic raincoats to protect themselves from the spray.</p>

<h2>Ripley's Package</h2>
<p>The Ripley's package consists of three attractions that come in a package. You can buy separate tickets but the package is an excellent deal. The package consists of the following attractions:
<br/><br/>
<b>Ripley's Believe it or Not museum: </b> A museum showcasing over 700 different oddities and illusions. The museum itself is rather interesting. It is shaped like a toppled empire state building.
<br/><br/>
<b>Ripley's Moving Theatre: </b> A 3D interactive theatre where you ride on boards that you can move around a snowboard course or skate park.
<br/><br/>
<b>Louis Tussaud's Waxworks: </b> A wax museum housing wax figures of many different famous people. You can even pose for a photo op with them.
</p>

<h2>Journey Behind the Falls</h2>
<p>Accessed from the Table Rock Welcome Centre this tour goes behind the falls to 2 different observation decks and a tunnel behind the falls. You can look out from the tunnel to see the water thundering down in front of you at two different places.</p>

<h2>Other Activities</h2>
