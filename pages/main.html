<h2>Physical Geography</h2>

<p>Niagara falls is the <i>most</i> unique land form in the area. The valley was formed by the same glaciers that formed the great lakes. Water plunged off a cliff and started eroding away the softer shale underneath the limestone cap rock that eroded more slowly. This slow erosion moved the falls slowly up the river to where they are now.</p>

<p>Niagara Falls is part of the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence lowlands landform region. Meaning it is excellent farm land with rich wet climate brown soil. The terrain is rolling hills and plains.</p>

<h2>Transport</h2>
Because of the large amount of tourists that travel to Niagara, there are many different ways of getting there. There is a major highway, the 405, from Toronto. There are 2 major airports and 2 train stations, one of each in the US and in Canada. There are also regular buses from Toronto to Niagara.
<h2>Getting Around</h2>
<p>Niagara falls has it's own bus system with many different routes. As well as the normal buses there are also 3 special Falls Shuttle buses which go in loops visiting different attractions.</p>
<p>Niagara Parks also operates it's own people mover system. You can buy a full day pass for $9. The buses go in a loop visiting the major attractions.</p>
<p>I, however plan to get around by walking and driving. There are many nice walking paths and most of the attractions are clustered in one area so walking is an ideal method of transportation. I am going to drive to Niagara so I will have a car to drive places if necessary.</p>

<h2>People</h2>
<img src="http://tristan.hume.ca/geosummative/scans/Tristan2011Scan-110529-0002.jpg" style="height:400px;float:right"/>
<p>Niagara's demographic sizes are fairly normal for Canada. You can clearly see the baby boomers in the demographic chart centred around 50. You can also see that there are significantly more women over 75 than men. The decline in birth rate in the 1970's (Generation X) is visible in the low number of people around 30 years old. The recent decline in birth rate is also visible in the 014 age range.</p>
<p>
17% of the population are immigrants but only 6% are visible minorities. This may be caused by people from Europe or the US immigrating to Niagara so they can retire in a nice town. The top 5 visible minorities in 2006 were:
<ol>
<li>Black</li>
<li>Latin American</li>
<li>South Asian</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Filipino</li>
</ol>
