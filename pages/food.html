<h1>Food and Lodging</h1>
<p>On any trip you always have to have places to stay and places to eat. I made a budget decision that I would spend money on going to a couple nice restaurants. It ends up that I will spend more on food than on activities.</p>

<h2>Accommodations</h2>
<p>I will be staying in the Days Inn & Suites By The Falls. It is a fairly cheap hotel (for Niagara Falls.) It has a free continental breakfast so I won't have to buy breakfast every day. It also has a pool, a hot tub and free internet. It costs $87 a night to stay in.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>I will be eating in around ten different places during my trip and I can't cover all of them in detail. Here are some of the interesting restaurants I will be eating in. For the approximate cost of each restaurant see the itinerary.</p>

<b>Secret Garden Restaurant - Day 2:</b> A restaurant hidden among a garden. It serves croisants, sandwiches, eggs and more.
<br/><br/>
<b>Skylon Tower - Day 2:</b> A high-end restaurant and viewing tower it has two dining rooms one of which is a rotating restaurant. I will  be eating in the cheaper and non-rotating buffet at the base of the tower but I will go up the tower to see the falls.
<br/><br/>
<b>Oh Canada Eh? - Day 3:</b> A bit of high-end foodtainment. This is a high end restaurant that is also a theatre! While you eat you watch a humourous musical about Canada's history.
<br/><br/>
<b>Casa Vostra - Day 4:</b> A high-rated Italian restaurant serving chicken, pasta and steak.
